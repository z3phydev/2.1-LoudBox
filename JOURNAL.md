# Total Time Spent - About 6 and a Half Hours

## 12/20/2025 - 3D Rough Ideas  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

I though what size I want it... 250mm x 250mm x 250mm, where did it come from? I have no clue. Luckily I have access to a lazer cutter and its going to be made out of 18mm ply, by altrenating 6mm sheets. ![Screenshot 2025-12-20 182325](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjY5MzgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a5306d65f58e9c0f036333687e2b43283ac010f6/Screenshot%202025-12-20%20182325.png)![Screenshot 2025-12-20 182252](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjY5MzksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--15674e8aaed84a8c9bfb1bcf5ace0b19e32b2ccd/Screenshot%202025-12-20%20182252.png)![Screenshot 2025-12-20 182230](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjY5NDAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--46e81f88ea0e193ac3e2646f2257f253580c3bde/Screenshot%202025-12-20%20182230.png)
  

## 12/29/2025 - Made all parts and laser cutting files  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

Now that I had my refrence I went on to make every side of the box. This is better demo of what the real thing might look like (other than the colours). I once recive the drivers will measure the holes to accurate sizes.

I've now mostly picked out all the componets. This will be around 140 watts in total, powered by a 5.5 DC barrel jack and 3.5mm audio jack for audio.

## 12/30/2025 4 PM - Created BOM and Repo  

_Time spent: 2.3h_  

Made a repo and uploaded DXFs and Step files. Look for all the parts and materials which took considerably longer than entcipated. I would have liked to add a touchscreen music control but its is already overbudget. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzI1MzYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--b49874d7b0d782295662bab081ad4efa2566432e/image.png)
  

## 12/30/2025 5 PM - Made a wiring diagram  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

I created a complete wiring diagram using KiCad, and because no suitable library part existed, I designed a custom schematic symbol for the ZK-MT21 amplifier.
